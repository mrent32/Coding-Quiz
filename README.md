# Coding-Quiz
This Application is designed to test a users knowledge of Javascript.
As a growing programmer, it is very beneficial to have a place to be able to quiz yourself on all the knowledge you have acquired at several different points in your journey. It helps to be able to see your score and know whether you are retaining the information you're learning. For this reason I have built this coding quiz that has a number of questions on Javascript basics. It is timed so that there is an added element of pressure to the quiz, and the application both rewards you for getting questions correct and also punishes for getting questions wrong; either by adding or subtracting 10 seconds for the respective outcome of the question. Included below is a screenshot of the application and a link to the deployed site.
